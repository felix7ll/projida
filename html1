            My name is Felix Langham, I was born in Australia but my whole family is English. I graduated in 2018 and can speak a bit of Spanish from my time in School.
            Some of my favourite hobbies include snowboarding and djing which I try to do as often as I can.
            <br>
            Fun fact about me: In 2019 I spent six months 'studying' in Helsing√∏r, Denmark at a
            'Folk High School' known as 'International Peoples College.'

        <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
        <ul>
          <p>
            <li>Although I have been surrounded by IT for most of my life there are a few key moments where I have delved deeper into the tech world.
              <br>
              After watching Mr. Robot a few years ago I downloaded a virtual machine to run Linux and tried to teach
              myself SSH through the website 'bandit wargames.' This was semi-successful.
              Before that, I had hacked my Xbox in order to remove parental controls after my parents had tried to limit my gaming. And before that, I had had to login to my computer without wiping it, after forgetting my password by installing windows on
              a USB and going through some
              complicated system processes which I found on Youtube.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Whether it's removing administrative controls from school laptops or running command prompts to login into my desktop to avoid losing my files I have often found myself in the tech space.
              As for what interests me, as much as the job opportunities are great, I enjoy tackling the many challenges that arise in coding, the puzzles to solve so that my python code runs properly or figuring out the correct CSS so that my
              website does what I want it to do. Furthermore, I am interested in learning how to program as it is a highly employable skill can also be applied to a wide variety of fields, and would
              give me a good basis on which to create any IT projects or ideas I might have.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              I chose RMIT because of its reputation, industry connections, and because my friends did this course. The RMIT university expo at my school in year 12 also sold it pretty well.
              Whilst at RMIT I expect to learn the fundamentals of various IT fields and then hone in on coding and programming later on.

          <h2 class="mbss">Myers Briggs Personality Test Results</h2>
          <p class="profilet">My Myers Briggs test result showed the 'Commander' profile with code: ENTJ-A. It further stated that; ENTJ's are planners who often have schedules and courses of action
            planned. Highly rational, excel at taking charge and good at spotting problems. I would say this is somewhat accurate, as I like to make schedules, however I don't always follow through with them.</p>

          <h3>Strengths</h3>
          <p class="profilet">'Efficient, Energetic, Self-Confident, Strong-willed, Strategic Thinker, Charismatic and Inspiring.' The results of my test, are not all true,
            although I would say I am efficient and strong-willed which would benefit collaborative projects as I am able to get my share of the work done on schedule. </p>

          <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
          <p class="profilet">'Stubborn and dominant, Intolerant, Impatient, Arrogant, Poor handling of Emotions, Cold and Ruthless.' Of these being stubborn, and dominant are probably
            the most accurate, at least in terms of how they may affect others when working in a team.</p>

          <h3>Team Composition</h3>
          <p class="profilet">'Commanders are confident, and they communicate one vision, to get the job done as
            efficiently as possible, however, subordinate positions are challenging for Commanders.' In forming a team, according to the data, I would work well
            as the leader however, I think I wouild also work great as a subordinate and don't mind others being in charge, creating plans and delegating.
            Furthermore it is indicated that I could be stubborn,
            impatient and strong-willed. These characteristics may have a negative impact on my behaviour within a team if we could not come to agreements about the project at hand.
            However ultimately I don't think that they are a big issue and I can be dynamic able to work well in a varity teams and team structures.
          </p>

          <h3>Vark Learning Style Test</h3>
          <p class="profilet"> According to this test, my strengths are in my ability to organize and plan in a and detail-oriented fashion. When assigned a project,
            I am able to easily establish order and structure plans. These results are inline with my Myers Briggs results and I would say they are fairly accurate.
            In addition, the results show that it is neccessary for me to step away from administrative roles and share my own ideas and contribution to projects and not
            get stuck in planning and organisation, this is more true as I often find myself doing just that.
          </p>

          <h3>The Big 5 Personality Test</h3>
          <p class="profilet">According to the 'Big Five Personality Test' I scored highly in extroversion, emotional stability and conscientiousness. Whilst scoring lower in Intellect/Imagination and
            agreeableness. This means that I may be, sociabe, practical, calm, helpful and disciplined. These results indicate some of what has been shown in previous tests, being practical and
            disciplined and I would say are fairly accurate.</p>

      <!-- MY PROJECT -->

      <div class="projectmain">
        <br>
        <h2 class="projida">Project Idea</h2>
        <ul>
          <br>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <li>
            <p class="projectt"> As someone who recently took an interest in personal finance I was keen to create a project that may help myself and others achieve their financial goals.
              My idea is to create an Investment app in which spare change from electronic or cashless purchases is rounded up and invested into a choice of cryptocurrency profiles with varying risk.
              This allows the user to invest in cryptocurrency whilst not taking any time out of their day.
              <br>
              Investing in cryptocurrency is relatively high risk it often requires lots of research which can be
              quite time consuming. However, once the app is installed, cards and bank accounts are linked, the user need not invest anymore time than they would like to.
              <br>
              <br>
              This app is ideal for people new to investing in cryptocurrency or investing in general. It allows them to invest without any hassle and feel as if they are on the right
              path, even if they are only making relatively small contributions, as it can quickly add up. It gives power to younger investors who may not have the best grasp on their financial situation,
              in a stress free and easy to use way. Key features include, buying and selling crypto, staking which allows users to earn interest on their holdings, up to date news coverage, and a calendar with upcoming events for coins.
              In addition, the app would also have an education section with videos and guides explaining the most important and relevant concepts in the cryptocurreny space.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <li>
            <p class="projectt">According to a recent data by 'Robinhood,' the most popular investing app, 40% of young Australians (aged 18-25) invested in the stock market in 2020. This
              shows that there is a large market for cryptocurrency apps targeted towards young investors. Most likely the percentage of young Australians invested in cryptocurrency is far lower, which gives the app huge potential.
              As of 2021 Cryptocurrency is booming, with Bitcoin creating all-time highs upwards of $60,000 USD, causing widespread interest with institutions and retail investors piling in.
              However, for most people cryptocurrency can seem like an extremely risky investman, just a 'fad' and highly speculative, some of which would be true. This app can introduce them to the space, whilst educating them,
              taking as little of their time as possible and offering small deposits, reducing the users risk.
              <br>
              <br>
              If young people are interested in cryptocurrency but aren't sure if it is a safe investment, this app would allow dip their toes in the water and invest with peace of mind.
              This is possible due to the 'spare change' investmen model which requires no work and allows users to begin investing minimal amounts.
              <br>
              <br>
              Cryptocurrency has shown great returns over the past decade and continues to grow. If investors are interested but don't want to risk a large portion of their capital, they can gain exposure whilst
              maintaining peace of mind and feeling as if they are getting in on some of the action.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <li>
            <p class="projectt"> My idea is an investing app that helps to bring young and inexperienced investors into the world of cryptocurrency in an easily accessible,
              informative and efficient manner. Simply by setting up an account and linking their debit cards, spare change will be rounded up and invested into
              a premade portfolio of stocks, of which one can choose a higher or lower risk portfolio. Features include, staking cryptocurrency, educational videos about blockchain and other related topics.
              A collection of various news sources to keep the user up to date, and a list of upcoming events for coins.
              <br>
              Specifically, this app is targeted towards younger investors aged 18-25. This type of investing is great for younger investors as they
              are able
              to take on more risk than older investors with more to lose, and less time to gain it back. One of the main features of this app that makes it appealing to younger
              investors is its spare change investing model. For every purchase made on a debit card, google pay or similar payments, the cost will be rounded up to the nearest dollar. Actual cost will then be decucted from rounded up cost, leaving
              the spare change.
              This spare change will be measured over time and once it reaches $10 it will be invested automatically into allocated coins from the users chosen portfolio.
              <br>
              <br>
              One of the biggest problems with investing in cryptocurrency the time required to research coins to invest in. However, with the pre-allocated investing profiles (from high to low risk) this time is given back to the user.
              Risk is further mitigated by the gradual deposits in users account over time, accumulated from purchases. This is akin to 'dollar cost averaging,' an investment strategy in which
              funds are invested in small amounts over a period of time rather than investing a lump some all at once. This helps to reduce the volatility of assets invested into, as the asset may move up or down vastly but by
              dollar cost averaging the users 'entry price' averages out over time. For example: if you bought a cryptocurrency at $100 worth of a coin at $100 then it dropped to $50 your buy price is $100 and you have lost 50% of your investmet.
               However, if you bought in amounts of $20 as the cryptocurrency dropped from $100 to $50 your average buy in price could be $75.
               <br>
               Furthermore buying cryptocurrency consistently, regardless of the markets ups or downs a.k.a dollar cost averaging, gives the user optimum assurance that their money is safe and
               allows for great risk management.
              <br>
              <br>
              Another feature of the app apart from the sign up and forget 'spare change' investing feature is the ability to lock in a coin for certain periods
              of time in order to earn interest on the investment. This is known as staking and if the users time horizon for returns is long enough, has limited downsides
              with great upside potential.
              <br>
              <br>
              Furthermore, there would be a tab in the app to check on current news in the cryptocurrency space. This would be curated from a variety of sources.
              Additionally, users would be able to see the 'roadmaps' of the coins they have invested in and any other coins that they are not invested in with upcoming events. This could help to
              assure them of their investment whilst also allowing them to choose coins they like the look of and believe in the long term vision of as seen in their roadmaps.
              <br>
              <br>
              Educational content would also be available, educating the user on how cryptocurrency actually work, what their real life use case is and helpful investing advice catered towards cryptocurrency.
              Lastly, all the basic features that come with an cryptocurrency exchange would be included such as buy, sell and the recurring buy sell feature, seperate to 'spare change investing'.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
          <li>
            <p class="projectt">
              In order to develop this app the most basic necessity would be to have access to a computer in order to write the code for the app.
              Primarily the app would be developed in Java, as well as making use of ‚ÄòMobile Backend as a service‚Äô also known as MBaaS. MBaaS would
              allow the developer to link their application to cloud storage, API‚Äôs and provide features such as push notifications, neccesary for providing breaking news.
              <br>
              <br>
              The developer must also have access to API‚Äôs such as ‚ÄòPlaid‚Äô. An API is an application computing interface that allows for interactions between multiple
              software applications. Furthermore, Plaid would allow bank accounts and other cashless payment methods to be linked to the app.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <h3>Skills Required</h3>
          <li>
            <p class="projectt">In order to develop and launch this project, the app would need to be designed and programmed. The skills required to
              complete these tasks would involve extensive knowledge and experience using the programming language Java, as well as the ability to
              design the User Interface which would allow the users to easily navigate the app and its functions.
              <br>
              <br>
              Knowledge of API‚Äôs and how to use them would also be required. API‚Äôs such as plaid would allow bank accounts and other cashless payment systems to be linked to
              the app whilst calculating and investing rounded up spending.
              <br>
              <br>
              Although a base model of the app and its functions may be designed with barebones skills in programming, to be on par with the competition, an extensive knowledge
              of the aforementioned skills would be required. Although not hard to achieve, it would take time. Thus the programming and design could be outsourced to one of thousands of programmers if necessary.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <li>
            <p class="projectt">If this app is developed successfully it would be very viable and competitive in the cryptocurrency space as all other apps with similar functions are either derelict or have mounting negative reviews.
              Furthermore, this app allows users to have quick and easy access to cryptocurrency investing via a well-designed and highly functional app, something currently missing from the appstore.
              This directly solves the original problem which is that there are no legitimate competitors that have an app available for this services. The traffic acquired
              by the development and successful launch of the app would be worth the initial investment of capital and time, and would likely bring new investors into the cryptocurrency space.
              Furthermore, if the app was developed, it would fill a market need and tap into a relatively untapped market. Ultimately, the app would fulfill its main purpose of introducing
              young new investors to cryptocurrency investing and helping people to save money and grow their wealth by investing their spare change.
